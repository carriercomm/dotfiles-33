# Quick shortcut to an graphical editor.
#
# This means that as I travel back and forth between editors, hey, I don't have
# to re-learn any arcane commands. Neat.
#
# USAGE:
#
#   $ ge
#   # => opens the current directory in your editor
#
#   $ ge .
#   $ ge /usr/local
#   # => opens the specified directory in your editor
